# LA Crime Visualization and Analysis
This is a group project. Teams includes Jing Li and Linyan Dai.

### Goal
This project aims to analyze crimes that happened in LA regarding its trend, type, and location by visualizing the data in Tableau.

### Dataset
The [LA Crime dataset](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z) contains incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2010. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. We cleaned the data in Python to make more accurate analysis.

### Visualization
